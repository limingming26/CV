## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at the University of Innsbruck. Currently, I am engaged in a research project funded by the Austrian Science Fund, titled “Affluence and the Gender Gap in STEM Study Choices,” under the supervision of Professor Uunk. Additionally, I hold the position of academic editor at PLoS ONE. My academic credentials include a Master of Philosophy in Economics from Central European University, a Master of Arts in Economics from Corvinus University of Budapest, and a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Sichuan University. My research primarily focuses on gender inequality and environmental economics, areas in which I have authored over ten peer-reviewed publications.
